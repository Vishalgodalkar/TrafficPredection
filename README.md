ðŸš¦ LSTM Traffic Flow Prediction
Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib
â€¢ Built an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict real-time traffic volume using time-series data.
â€¢ Processed vehicle count data (car, bike, truck, bus) and generated sequential inputs with a sliding window approach.
â€¢ Trained and evaluated the model with visualizations and heatmaps to identify peak traffic periods.
â€¢ Exported the model for deployment in smart city traffic systems.
